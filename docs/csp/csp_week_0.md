### 5.1 Notes

Notes

### [Tri 3 TPT 0.1 related to Beneficial and Harmful Effects of Computing Big Idea 5.1](https://github.com/nighthawkcoders/nighthawk_csp/wiki/Tri-3-TPT-0.1-related-to-Beneficial-and-Harmful-Effects-of-Computing-Big-Idea-5.1)

1. Come up with three of your own Beneficial and corresponding Harmful Effects of Computing
* Technology allows anyone to share information with anyone, allowing easy access of data. This also means that there is a lot of misinformation or fake information out there.
* Predicting natural disasters is easier.
* GPS allows us to go anywhere and take the fastest route without needing to look up directions ahead of time. Unfortunately, GPS malfunctions or lack of GPS may cause people that were previously dependent on GPS to get lost.

2. Talk about dopamine issues above. Real? Parent conspiracy? Anything that is impacting your personal study and success in High School?
* I've seen dopamine issues effect many people around my age, including myself. Social platforms are sources of dopamine, granting instant gratification through posts, videos, memes, and discussion topics. However, viewing these too often will give an overload of dopamine, causing the brain to create more dopamine receptors (neurons that process dopamine). As a result, doing anything else besides spending time on social platforms will grant a lower proportion of dopamine compared to the new receptors created, causing levels of happiness to be lower than normal.

### 5.2 Notes

Notes

### [Tri 3 TPT 0.2 related to Digital Divide Big Idea 5.2](https://github.com/nighthawkcoders/nighthawk_csp/wiki/Tri-3-TPT-0.2-related-to-Digital-Divide-Big-Idea-5.2)

1. How does someone empower themselves in a digital world?
* Empowerment in a digital world is as simple as having free, easy access to technology.

2. How does someone that is empowered help someone that is not empowered? Describe something you could do at Del Norte HS.
* Providing financial help could allow someone to afford technology of their own. A way to help a bunch of people like students at Del Norte is doing something like creating a public computer lab where anyone can use the computers, or having a bunch of cheap computers available for checkout to students that need it.

3. Is paper or red tape blocking digital empowerment? Are there such barriers at Del Norte? Elsewhere?
* Red Tape somewhat blocks digital empowerment by eliminating the 'freedom' aspect of technology. However, I do get that it keeps students safe by preventing off-topic searches and account break-ins that breach privacy.
