## Week 0 - [Ticket](https://github.com/Archkitten/CS-AP-2/issues/2)

### (TPT) Study Group Challenges

Assignment:
* Java Menu that is not hard coded (Use object array?)
* Number Swap option that sorts two numbers from least to greatest
* Matrix Format option that prints a numpad and keyboard

Test Prep Plans for success:
* Array Data structure needs different classes to run, but Arrays can only have one data type.
* Therefore, Inheritance and Late Binding is needed to store different object types into the same Array.

AP Exam Plans for success:
* Pair Review unfamiliar topics
* Do more MCQ problems
* Review Tri 2 FRQs, maybe rework some or improve upon them

Final Result:
* Link to code + runtime: [CS-AP-2 Java Replit](https://replit.com/@ArchHuang/CS-AP-A?lite=true)
* Ticket: [Ticket](https://github.com/Archkitten/m221-nitro-code/issues/1)
