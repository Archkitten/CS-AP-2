# CSA

{% include csa_nav.html %}

## Week 5 - [Ticket](https://github.com/Archkitten/CS-AP-2/issues/15)

### Plan

1. Study Java syntax for for-loops.
2. Review Array and ArrayList syntax differences.
3. Increase speed for MCQs on conditional, looping, and recursive problems.
4. Practice writing code on paper.
5. Review Truth Tables and De Morgan's Law
6. Java default libraries like substring()

Syntax Practice
```java
public class lol {
    private int asdf = 0;
    private String fff = "asdf";
    
    public int getAsdf() {
        return asdf;
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        lol l = new lol();
    }
}
```

Watch out for super class calls!

Unit 9 MCQ Question 3 is tricky. Review it over and over and over again so I don't get tricked again.


I will continue adding onto this study plan. I've still got a lot to review and iterate upon, so it's not done yet!
