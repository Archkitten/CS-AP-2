# CSA

{% include csa_nav.html %}

## Week 5 - [Ticket](https://github.com/Archkitten/CS-AP-2/issues/15)

### Plan

1. Study Java syntax for for-loops.
2. Review Array and ArrayList syntax differences.
3. Increase speed for MCQs on conditional, looping, and recursive problems.
4. Practice writing code on paper.

Syntax Practice
```java
public class lol {
    private int asdf = 0;
    private String fff = "asdf";
    
    public int getAsdf() {
        return asdf;
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        lol l = new lol();
    }
}
```

Watch out for super class calls!

Unit 9 MCQ Question 3 is dumb. Review it over and over and over again so I don't get tricked again.
