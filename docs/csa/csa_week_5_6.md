            1. Study Java syntax for for-loops.
            <br>
            2. Review Array and ArrayList syntax differences.
            <br>
            3. Increase speed for MCQs on conditional, looping, and recursive problems.
            <br>
            4. Practice writing code on paper (No IDE or W3 schools syntax help).
            <br>
            5. Watch out for super() class calls.
            <br>
            6. Unit 9 MCQ Question 3 is tricky. Review it over and over again, so I don't get tricked in the future.

            7. Review Truth Tables and De Morgan's Law.
            <br>
            8. Memorize how java default libraries like substring() work.
            <br>
            9. Study how java for-each loops work with arrays (2015 MCQ Question 22).
            <br>
            10. Be careful when the inner nested for loop sets it's starting/stopping point based on the value of the outer for loop.

            Questions Missed: None!
            <br>
            Questions Unanswered: 23, 26 and onwards.
            <p>
                Question 23: []
                <br>
                []
            </p>
            <p>
                Question 26: E
                <br>
                The changeIt() method isn't doing anything because there is no return type. Therefore, the start() method will print out 1 2 3 4 5 6 blackboard.
            </p>
            <p>
                Question 27: B
                <br>
                The sort is a selection sort. 1st pass: 6 and 1 get swapped. 2nd pass: 3 and 2 get swapped. 3rd pass: 3 and 5 don't get swapped. End result is 1 2 3 5 4 6.
            </p>
            <p>
                Question 28: B
                <br>
                The sort is a selection sort. It'll compare 15 times because 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1. It'll swap 5 times because there are 5 pairs available to swap (5 iterations happen).
            </p>
            <p>
                Question 29: A
                <br>
                3 returns 1, 40 returns 1+1=2, 100 returns 1+1+1=3, 564 returns 1+1+1=3. It's just the number of digits.
            </p>
            <p>
                Question 30: B
                <br>
                (II) only. (I) and (III) always runs the code for 0-4 boxes.
            </p>
            <p>
                Question 31: E
                <br>
                The two starting points for X's are (1, 0) and (3, 0). Then keep creating X's one row down and one column over. So from (1, 0) the next X's would be (0, 1), and from (3, 0) the next X's would be (2, 1), (1, 2), and (0, 3).
            </p>
            <p>
                Question 32: B
                <br>
                B is the only one that correctly uses getters, treats k as an element and not as an index number, and doesn't have syntax errors.
            </p>
