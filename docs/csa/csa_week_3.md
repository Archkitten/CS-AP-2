## Week 3 - [Ticket](https://github.com/Archkitten/CS-AP-2/issues/7)

### (TPT) Study Group Challenge 3

Objective 1: Build all of these into your data structures.
* Here are the Sorts that CB wants you to work with and should work well with Queue that students developed in earlier labs: Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort
* Consider Quick Sort and Merge Sort and its nature. Build a custom Merge Sort using a data structure that supports binary analysis.

Objective 2: Perform analysis on all of these sorts using 5,000 random pieces of data.
* Build a Wiki that describes your Sort implementations and the Big O complexity of that implementation.
* Establish analytics for comparisons and swaps average to perform each sort, run each at least 10 times and calculate an average
* Additionally, establish a timer and calculate average time for each of the sorts.
* Make a final/judgement on best sort considering Data Structure loading, Comparisons, Swaps, Big O complexity, and Time.
