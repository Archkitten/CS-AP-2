### [Tech Talk 0: Data Structures](https://github.com/nighthawkcoders/nighthawk_csa/wiki/Tri-3:-Tech-Talk-0---Data-Structures) Notes

* Imperative Paradigm: Procedural Programming like Python
* Object-Oriented Programming: Java, uses Objects and Classes, Inheritance, Abstraction, and Polymorphism
* Big Tech Companies Stock: Google, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon
* Assignment: Make a menu based off of a data structure, Challenge 1 and Challenge 2 and Matrix

### [AP Prep 0: Study Group Challenges](https://github.com/nighthawkcoders/nighthawk_csa/wiki/Tri-3:-Tech-Talk-0---Data-Structures#challenges) - [Ticket](https://github.com/Archkitten/m221-nitro-code/issues/1)

Plans for success:
* Array Data structure needs different classes to run, but Arrays can only have one data type.
* Therefore, Inheritance and Late Binding is needed to store different object types into the same Array.

Final Result:
* Link to code + runtime: [CS-AP-2 Java Replit](https://replit.com/@ArchHuang/CS-AP-2?lite=true)
* Ticket: [Ticket](https://github.com/Archkitten/m221-nitro-code/issues/1)
