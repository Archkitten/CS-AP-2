            GC contains user input through mouse clicks and keyboard inputs.
            A list will also be used to store objects that can be displayed on the screen.
            This project will use Object-Oriented Programming, with each object containing functions that allow it to preform tasks like updating position or changing variables based on user input.
            An algorithm will be used to remove objects that aren't needed anymore, as well as iterate through the list in order to display each object on the screen.
